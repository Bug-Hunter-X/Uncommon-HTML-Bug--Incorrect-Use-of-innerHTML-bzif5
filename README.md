This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in HTML involving the use of innerHTML to append elements dynamically.  Improper use of innerHTML can lead to unexpected results or even security vulnerabilities in certain situations.

The `bug.html` file showcases the incorrect approach, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected implementation.

This example highlights the importance of understanding how to properly manipulate the DOM using JavaScript for a secure and efficient web application.  Avoid directly manipulating innerHTML whenever possible.
